<h1>How I Built This Site</h1>
    


    <p>
     In July 2020, when everything slowed down due to the coronavirus pandemic, I wanted to find a way to best utilize my knowledge in HTML and CSS and improve upon it. That got me thinking - "why don't I build a website?"

	<br> </br>

     As a newcomer to web-building, I grappled with many ideas. Assimilating all those thoughts to match my vision became quite the challenge. 

	<br> </br>

     Luckily for me, I had a lot of guidance - especially from w3schools.com ,  an online coding and learning platform. 

	<br> </br>

     Here are a few sheets of paper with my preliminary ideas for this website.




<br> </br>

     I used TextEdit on my MacBook Pro to build this site. This allowed me to simulatenously work on different parts of the webpage. I mainly used HTML and CSS for the site itself, but imported some icons and fonts from web-building API's and other websites. Through all this, I learned quite a lot about the nuances of the languages, getting more and more experienced in them.
