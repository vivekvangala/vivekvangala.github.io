<h1>How I Built This Site</h1>
    


    <p>
     In July 2020, when everything slowed down due to the coronavirus pandemic, I wanted to find a way to best utilize my knowledge in HTML and CSS and improve upon it. That got me thinking - "why don't I build a website?"

	<br> </br>

     Creating the site required some planning, so I designed some simple outlines for what I wanted it to look like. I wanted to practice using some concepts I learned, so incorporating those became my priority.

	<br> <br>
	
     Numerous portions of the webpage were created with programming tactics I wasn't quite familiar with. For instance, the gallery of photos needed JavaScript along with HTML and CSS to work, so it took a long time for me to learn how to get all that done.

	<br> <br>
    
     Media queries were another part of the site that I needed to create, as it is those which allow people to view the site on both mobile and desktop devices. After a few hours of research and practice, I eventually was able to incorporate these into the webpage. Once I was able to access the site properly on my phone, I knew that work paid off.

	<br> <br>
     Probably the biggest challenge I had was finding a place to host the site. I bought "vivekvangala.com", but there was a problem with the DNS (Domain Name Server) configuration - so I couldn't end up using it. After trying a plethora of hosting sites, I settled on Github. Github allowed me to import all the files I wanted, and actually click a button that said "publish" to get the site up and running on the Internet. Even though I had to compromise with the domain name, Github made it really smooth with publishing the site.

	<br> <br>

     Now the site is at a state which I'm happy with, and everything turned out the way I wanted it to. Creating it was a learning experience, and I'm glad I was able to pursue a goal in this and meet it.
